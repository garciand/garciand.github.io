I am a recent M. Sc. in Industrial Engineering graduate in the State University of Navarre with a strong international experience due to my 2 stays in Germany: one while writing my bachelor thesis at Hochschule Niederrhein and the other while doing an internship and writing my master's thesis at FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik. I have been recognized with an Extraordinary University Award for being among the top 1% of the best GPA-s in the bachelor's degree.

I am currently working as a Grid Integration Automatization Engineer in Nordex Group, where I am involved in projects with constant communication with TSOs of countries all over the world. I automate and produce wind farm simulation and integration models using python in a wide variety of softwares, such as DIgSILENT, PSSE and PSCAD. I am also pursuing a part-time PhD related to new energy technologies and techniques in a cotutelle PhD program between the State University of Navarre and the Case Western Reserve University (yet to be officially confirmed).

My main interests are management of artificial intelligence related topics and its applications to industry. That is why I am taking online courses on Advanced Machine Learning. I am a very active and adaptable person, with great self-learning skills. I would be highly motivated to change from area, sector or geographic location, as my background covers a wide range of interantional and sector knowledge.

My main area of knowledge is software and programming engineering for industry and everything related to it, having both academic and working experience with blockchain and tangle (IOTA) enviroments, Object-Oriented Programming, Asymmetric and Symmetric Cryptography, vhdl and verilog programming for FPGA-s, Neural Networks in Python, MySQL, git, Linux Environments, Hypervisor Structures and Machine Learning. I also have leadership and managements skills acquired during my Industrial Engineering studies and internships.

I am a person who likes challenges and who is passionate about being continuously learning, who gives the best of himself in high-stress environments under pressure. Do not hesitate to contact me!
