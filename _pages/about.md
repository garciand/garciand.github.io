Asier Garciandia López was born in Pamplona, Spain, in 1995. He received the B.Sc. International Industrial Engineering and M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering degrees from the Public University of Navarra, Spain, in 2019. Since March 2020, he has been working in the automotive industry as a production manager with Volkswagen AG, where being in charge of a team of 40 people, he has developped strong leadership and management skills. In parallel, he is involved as a researcher at the Energy Technology group of the Public University of Navarra and is collaborating with the Embedded Systems and Sensors Engineering department from the FZI Research Center for Information Technology.

His research interests include hardware and software security. His research interests further include artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data architectures. Specifically he has both academic and working experience with blockchain and tangle enviroments, Object-Oriented Programming, Asymmetric and Symmetric Cryptography, VHDL and Verilog programming for FPGA-s, Neural Networks in Python, MySQL, git, Linux Environments, Hypervisor Structures, Machine Learning and OpenCL and  SYCL basics. As it can be noted from his background, he is a person who likes challenges and who is passionate about being continuously learning, giving the best of himself in high-stress environments under pressure. 

Asier is also pursuing a part-time PhD under the supervision of Professors Dr. Maria García Sanz and Dr. Pedro María Dieguez Elizondo. The main focus of the PhD relies in harnessing tidal energy as a new energy source.  He focuses on how to exploit marine energy more efficiently, and thus, make it profitable, exploring new technologies and applying Big Data Processing and Machine Learning techniques to help on that purpose.

I hope you find the site interesting, whether you are an experienced researcher or a simple engineering student, as I am most happy to know that I bring something to the world. If I could describe myself in one sentence, I would undoubtedly choose the famous quote from Steve Jobs "If today were the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today?"
