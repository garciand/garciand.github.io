Hi everyone,

Once I have completed the [course offered by Dr. Joaquin Sevilla](https://abai-g9.blogspot.com), I would like to share my opinion regarding the topics that I have found more useful and instructive for my future life as a scientist. 

The topic that has caught my attention the most is the one about plagiarism and scientific fraud. This is usually seen as a taboo subject inside the scientific community, and thus, we try to avoid talking about it. However, thanks to the behaviour and understanding between colleagues in this course, it was possible for Dr. Sevilla to go deeper on it. The truth is that everyone commits plagiarism in lower or higher extend, but the important thing is to be able to draw a line from which we consider what we are doing to be unethical:

I also found very instructive the explanations regarding how to write and publish correctly a scientific paper, since I was able to understand why the publishing process is so rigurous, although it also made me question the need for this to be so: issue that I already addressed in [Paper publishing system](https://garciand.github.io/paper_publishing_system/).

# CONCLUSIONS

I want to thank Dr. Joaquin Sevilla for this course. Thanks to him I have been able to better understand how things work in the scientific community, as well as to better judge what could be considered as good praxis and what could be instead considered as bad praxis. I also found necessary to have a webinar in order to end up with the course, since it made it possible to us to listen to the other colleagues in the course, as well as to learn from their research experiences. It was a pleasure for me to attend this online course.
